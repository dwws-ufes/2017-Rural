# Rural

Rural is a system that helps municipalities to manage the invoices issued by rural producers. It provides an efficient way of locating supposedly unproductive properties and consequently (with the work of municipal inspection) to increase the collection of ICMS onlendings.

## How to deploy

1. Install [Eclipse jee Neon 3](http://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php); 

2. Install [WildFly 10](http://wildfly.org) and create a Server configuration within Eclipse;
  2.1. Remember to install JBoss's plugin for proper use of Wildfly Application Servers (follow the link in the "Note" for more details).

3. Install [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/products/community/) and create a schema called `produtorrural` and a user called `produtorrural` with password `produtorrural` and full access to the homonymous database;

4. Configure [the MySQL JDBC driver](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) in WildFly;

5. Configure the datasource in WildFly's `standalone.xml` file:

```XML
<datasource jta="true" jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/ProdutorRural" pool-name="ProdutorRuralPool" enabled="true" use-java-context="true">
    <connection-url>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/produtorrural</connection-url>
    <driver>mysql</driver>
    <security>
        <user-name>produtorrural</user-name>
        <password>produtorrural</password>
    </security>
</datasource>
``` 

Note: if you need detailed instructions on how to set up Eclipse, WildFly and MySQL, please refer to this [tutorial at nemo-utils wiki](https://github.com/nemo-ufes/nemo-utils/wiki/Tutorial%3A-a-Java-EE-Web-Profile-application-with-nemo-utils%2C-part-1).

## Configuring the project inside Eclipse

Usually, the project misses some dependencies when imported into Eclipse. Checking the following step should be enough for everything to work:

1.  Inside the project's properties, set Wildfly 10 as Target Runtime

2.  Into the Build Path, add the libraries for:
    - JavaSE - 1.8
    - Maven Dependencies
    - Server Runtime

3.  Into the projects Facets, disable and re-enable JSF and JPA facets checking the "Further Configurations" option to use the libraries provided by the target runtime.
